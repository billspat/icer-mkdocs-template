!!! warning
    This is as a **Lab Notebook** which describes how to solve a specific problem at a specific time.
    Please keep this in mind as you read and use the content. Please pay close attention to the date, version
    information and other details.

File and title naming conventions:

    Lab Notebooks are sorted by filename, but the display name on the documentation page is determined by the title tag.

    [05-09-2023] We have changed file ordering over to date, so file names should begin with a date in yyyy-mm-dd_ and the
    title tag of the file should begin with a date in (yyyy-mm-dd_)

    [WARNING: Information below this point is out of date, but is still a good explanation of file ordering]
    We are currently (as of 3-30-2023) trying to order LabNotebooks by a "MainTopic" which is usually a specific software/packages/etc 
    as most Lab Notebooks are about installing or running software/packages (with some exception, see OnDemand). As such please try to 
    stick to the following convetions when naming and titling your Lab Notebooks

    Filenames should follow the format:
        
            "LabNotebook_<MainTopic>_<SubTopic>.md"

    where <MainTopic> is typically the name of the software, package, or lanaguage that the Notebooks is about, with the first letter 
    capitalized (i.e. Anaconda, PyMesh, Python, OnDemand) and <SubTopic> is the specific process the Notebook is about (installation, 
    solving an error, running in parallel on SLURM)

    Titles should follow a similar foramt:

        "Lab Notebook: <MainTopic> <Subtopic> (<Date:yyyy-mm-dd>)"

    where <MainTopic> should be THE SAME as in the Filename to preserve ordering which is one reason using a single, capitalized name
    of software/package/etc is prefered. The <SubTopic> should be the same or similar as in the Filename, but it is not essential that 
    it be exactly the same. It is acceptable to change, expand, or rearrange the subtopic to make the title more human readable. Having Lab 
    Notbooks slightly out of order at the SubTopic level is fine as long as they are correltly grouped by MainTopic and the title clearly 
    describes the specific process the Lab Notebook deals with.Also, please include a date in yyyy-mm-dd format so that it is easy for 
    people to tell the age of the topic of the Lab Notebookd from the listing. This date should reflect the date the content was 
    created (i.e. when the process outlined was tested to work, not the last edit to text/title/etc)

    Finally, \internal title heading of the Lab Notebook do not affect ordering or apperance of the Lab Notebook page, so there are 
    no strict requirement here, but best pratice would be to have the first heading be something similar to the Filename/Title and also     
    include a date here as well.

    In Summary:
    
        Filename: Controls order on the Notebooks page;        "LabNotebook_<MainTopic>_<SubTopic>.md"
        Title: Visible on the Notebooks page;                  "Lab Notebook: <MainTopic> <Subtopic> (<Date:yyyy-mm-dd>)"
        Internal Header: Visible inside the notebook           "<Something human readable> (<Date:yyyy-mm-dd>)"

    Example:

        Filename: OnDemand_CantClickInteractiveDesktop
        Title:  OnDmeand --- Unable to click icons on the Interactive Desktop (2022-10-04)
        Internal Header: Lab Notebook --- Unable to click icons on the OnDemand Interactive Desktop (2022-10-04)
